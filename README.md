# Tidy German elections data

This repo provides tidy election data for German federal elections. There are 
two data sets. Both are available in .csv and .rds format. 

The 'btw_returns' data set provides district level vote counts for every federal 
election. 

The 'btw_candidates' data set contains the candidates for each election since 
2002. 

Both have been augmented with unique wikidata ids for the parties such that 
parties can be properly identified across time, and potentially further data can
be added.
